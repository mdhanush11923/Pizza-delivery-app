This project is a **full-stack Pizza Delivery Web App** that I built entirely on my own, using 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗼𝗗𝗕, 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁, 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀.𝗷𝘀, and 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲.𝗷𝘀, with additional tech and UI highlights:

🔑 **𝗪𝗲𝗯𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀**:

- Stunning UI built using **NextUI, Magic UI, shadcn/ui, and Material UI** components.

- **Dark mode and Light mode switch** for the entire website. 🌙☀️

- **AI-generated images** using ChatGPT prompts for high-quality visuals.

- **Login/signup screens** with error detection, password visibility icons, and clear buttons for input fields.

- Fully responsive **navbar with a toggle switch** for smaller screens.

- The **home page** includes:
  - A detailed **menu with 30+ pizzas** (veg and non-veg categories).
  - **Pizza sizes** (small, medium, large) with different prices.
  - **Visible stock and detailed descriptions.**
  - **Option to customize your own pizza**.
  - **Add to cart feature**, with data stored and visible in a modal.
  - **Remove items from the cart**, and checkout via **Razorpay** in test mode.

- The app is fully **responsive** with theme-switching capability.

- An **Admin Dashboard** for **CRUD operations** on pizza stocks like base, cheese, sauce, and veggies.

- **New Features:**
  - Razorpay integration for **seamless payment flow**.
  - Dynamic ingredient tracking and updating with **Combined State + API Approach**.
  - Pizza customization enhancements with **sliders for ingredient quantities**.
  - Simplified management of pizza stock for admins with a **streamlined dashboard**.
  - **MongoDB-backed cart and order management system** with real-time updates.

- Deployed on **GitHub** and built using the **MERN stack** with NextJs for enhanced performance.

- Styled with **TailwindCSS**, including a navbar that transforms into a menu with a toggle switch.


In addition to completing this project, I am excited to share that I have received a 𝗟𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗼𝗳 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝗟𝗼𝗥) for my hard work and successful completion of this challenge! 🏆

This has been an incredible journey, and I'm proud (and maybe a little sleep-deprived) to share my **first-project pizza delivery website**—designed, developed, and deployed by a single person—me! 🙌 Building it solo definitely felt like a wild ride, but totally worth it!
