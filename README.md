🚀 𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟯 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗱: 𝗣𝗶𝘇𝘇𝗮 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗪𝗲𝗯 𝗔𝗽𝗽 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗢𝗮𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗯𝘆𝘁𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽! 🍕🎉



I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed a 𝗟𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹 𝟯 𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸 (the hardest level) during my internship at 𝐎𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐬 𝐈𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐛𝐲𝐭𝐞! 💼



This project is a 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹-𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗣𝗶𝘇𝘇𝗮 𝗗𝗲𝗹𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗪𝗲𝗯 𝗔𝗽𝗽 that I built entirely on my own, using 𝗠𝗼𝗻𝗴𝗼𝗗𝗕, 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁, 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀.𝗷𝘀, and 𝗡𝗼𝗱𝗲.𝗷𝘀, with additional tech and UI highlights:



🔑 𝗪𝗲𝗯𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗲 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀:

- Stunning UI built using 𝗡𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗨𝗜 and 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗨𝗜 components.

- 𝗗𝗮𝗿𝗸 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲 switch for the entire website. 🌙☀️

- 𝗔𝗜-𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 using ChatGPT prompts for high-quality visuals.

- 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗻/𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝘂𝗽 𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻𝘀 with error detection, password visibility icons, and clear buttons for input fields.

- Fully responsive 𝗻𝗮𝘃𝗯𝗮𝗿 with a toggle switch for smaller screens.

- The 𝗵𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝗴𝗲 includes:

 - A detailed 𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘂 with 30+ pizzas (veg and non-veg categories).

 - Pizza sizes (small, medium, large) with different prices.

 - Visible stock and detailed descriptions.

 - Option to 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗽𝗶𝘇𝘇𝗮.

 - 𝗔𝗱𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗰𝗮𝗿𝘁 feature, with data stored and visible in a 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗮𝗹.

 - 𝗥𝗲𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲 𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 from the cart, and checkout via 𝗥𝗮𝘇𝗼𝗿𝗽𝗮𝘆 in test mode.

- The app is fully 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 with theme-switching capability.

- An 𝗔𝗱𝗺𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘀𝗵𝗯𝗼𝗮𝗿𝗱 for 𝗖𝗥𝗨𝗗 𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 on pizza stocks like base, cheese, sauce, and veggies.

- 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗲𝗱 𝗼𝗻 𝗚𝗶𝘁𝗛𝘂𝗯 and built using the 𝗠𝗘𝗥𝗡 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 with 𝗩𝗶𝘁𝗲+𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 for enhanced performance.

- Styled with 𝗧𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗦𝗦, including a navbar that transforms into a menu with a toggle switch.



This has been an incredible journey, and I'm proud (and maybe a little sleep-deprived) to share my 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁-𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 pizza delivery website—designed, developed, and deployed by a single person—me! 🙌 Building it solo definitely felt like a wild ride, but totally worth it!
